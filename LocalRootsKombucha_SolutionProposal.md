## S Local Roots Kombucha Solution Proposal
### Business Overview
Local Roots Kombucha is a hard kombucha and hard tea brewery with three revenue streams:

1. *Tap Room* (POS via Clover, scheduling via Homebase)
2. *Retail Distribution* (via Sunset Distributing, data via VT Info)
3. *Co-Packing* (production services for alicohol and non-alcohol products)

Teams operate across production, taproom service, sales, and marketing, with back-office operations managed via QuickBooks, GoEkos, Slack, and Gusto.

### Challenges & Opportunities
- Fragmented systems make it hard to track performance across P-NLs
- Manual planning and approval processes create inefficiencies
- No unified view of KPIs for decision-makers
- High dependency on individual tribal knowledge
- Under-leveraged potential in flavor innovation, marketing performance, and co-packing schedules

### Proposed Enterprise Platform Solution

#### 1. Unified Business Command Center
- Integrates financial (QuickBooks), POS (Clover), inventory (GoEkos), and distributor data (VT Info)
- Real-time dashboards and KPIs by revenue stream, SKU, region, and team
- Tiered access and mobile-friendly insights for leadership and operations

#### 2. End-to-End Workflow Automation
- Automates taproom tasks (inventory, staffing, scheduling)
- Co-packing client onboarding, production scheduling, and approvals through BPM/PMO modules
- RACI-aligned governance and approval workflows across departments

#### 3. Production & Inventory Synchronization
- Forecasts and auto-triggers production batches via MES and SCM modules
- Syncs inventory movements between GoEkos, taproom sales, and distributor demand

#### 4. Smart Distribution Expansion Planning
- Map-based store performance analysis using VT Info + sales data
- Identifies underpenetrated zones and recommends actions (marketing, pricing, SKUs)

#### 5. Flavor R&D & Customer Feedback Loop
- Structured forms for customer reviews at taproom and retail level
- Tracks ideas from testing to productization
- Supports go/no-go decisions based on cost, forecast, and feedback
#### 6. Cross-Team Communication & Efficiency
- Integrates Slack, Gusto, and Homebase data to align team schedules, HR, and marketing triggers
- Reduces redundant communication and increases task accountability
