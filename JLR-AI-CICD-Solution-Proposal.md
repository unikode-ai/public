# Solution Proposal: JLR CICD Automation & AI Roadmap on Enterprise Platform

### Client
Jaguar Land Rover (JLR)

### Business Context
JLR is engaged in the development of autonomous driving software and seeks to enhance its CI/CD pipeline automation. The company is also pursuing a robust AI roadmap and already leverages Microsoft tools such as Office 365 and SharePoint. The need is for scalable delivery with audit-ready traceability, real-time metrics, and AI readiness.

### Proposed Solution

### 1. CI/CD Visibility and Governance Framework
- **Visibility with Azure DevOps**: Connect CI/CD pipelines to the Enterprise Platform's PMO module for visibility and tracking.
- **Automated Approvals**: Use BPM workflows to enforce regulated approval gates at each release stage.
- **Live Dashboards**: Deploy Power BI dashboards to monitor release status, testing, and blockers.
- **GitLab Integrations**: seamless integration with existing environments.


### 2. AI Roadmap Management
- **Strategic Planning Module**: Track AI initiatives (e.g., Perception AI, V2X, L4readiness) within structured roadmaps.
- **KPI and Milestone Monitoring**: Tie initiatives to business KPIs and regulatory milestones.
- **Central Repository**: Capture test results, model code, and documentation within traceable structures.

### 3. Cross-Functional Coordination
- **Unified Data Model**: Link project planning, engineering execution, and risk/compliance artifacts.
- **RACI Enforcement**: Use tier-aligned roles for visibility and escalation (Tier 1$â€“ T)er 4 review structure).

### 4. AI-Readiness & Governance
- **Agent Orchestration System (AOS)**: Deploy intelligent agents for non-critical process automation.
- **Data Tagging and Governance**: Ensure traceability of AI model training and deployment data.
- **Predictive Insights**: Use analytics to forecast delays, quality issues, and model drift.

### Expected Outcomes
- 50% reduction in manual reporting workload
- End-to-end traceability from AI concept to validation
- Accelerated executive decision-making via real-time metrics
- Strong audit readiness and regulatory compliance
